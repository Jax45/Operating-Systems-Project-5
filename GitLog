    I had a problem with my queue, it was not enqueueing correctly, tried to fix it and got seg fault errors. now it seems to be working.
    Still need the 10,000 line limit, and fix statistics.

    todo next would be stats, avgwait function, multilevel queue, 100 processes, log file limit.

    Added queue 0 and can now use lots of processes. still need to wait for processes in timer signal instead of just terminating.

    The single process WORKS I can't believe it. took so much rewriting of code but it now works with 1 process.
    now i need to implement the round robin queue with priority of just 0 right now. and add more processes.
    need to create queue structure and keep track of it when i dispatch. LETS GO CARDINALS.
